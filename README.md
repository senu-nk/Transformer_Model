# Transformer Model Implementation Guide

This guide provides a recommended order for implementing classes and methods for a basic Transformer model. Please note that this is a basic order, and you can adjust it based on your own preferences and the specific requirements of your project.

## Recommended Order of Implementation

1. **Tokenizer**: The tokenizer is required for encoding and decoding the input and output sequences. There are built-in tokenization classes in TensorFlow, such as `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer`. However, for custom requirements, you may need to create your own tokenizer.

2. **Embedding Layer**: After the tokenizer, implement the embedding layer that converts the tokenized input sequences into dense vectors. This class is built-in in TensorFlow as `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`.

3. **Positional Encoding Layer**: This layer adds positional information to the input sequence embedding vectors. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

4. **Multi-Head Attention Layer**: Implement the multi-head attention layer as it is a key component of the Transformer model. This class is built-in in TensorFlow as `tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention`.

5. **Feedforward Layer**: Implement the feedforward layer that processes the output from the multi-head attention layer. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

6. **Layer Normalization**: Add layer normalization after each sub-layer in the Encoder and Decoder stacks. This class is built-in in TensorFlow as `tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization`.

7. **Encoder Layer**: Implement the Encoder layer, which consists of a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

8. **Decoder Layer**: Implement the Decoder layer, which consists of a multi-head attention layer, a feedforward layer, and an encoder-decoder attention layer. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

9. **Encoder**: Implement the Encoder stack, which consists of multiple Encoder layers. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

10. **Decoder**: Implement the Decoder stack, which consists of multiple Decoder layers. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

11. **Transformer**: Finally, implement the Transformer model that combines the Encoder and Decoder stacks to perform the sequence-to-sequence task. This class is not built-in in TensorFlow.

12. **Loss Function**: Implement a custom loss function that penalizes incorrect predictions during training.

13. **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Implement a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a recommended order for implementing the classes and methods for a basic Transformer model. Please note that this is a basic order, and you can adjust it based on your own preferences and the specific requirements of your project. With these classes and methods, you should be able to build a Transformer model that performs a sequence-to-sequence task.
